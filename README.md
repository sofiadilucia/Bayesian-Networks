Gigi's branch Readme

Done k2 algorithm, it seems that computations are not numerically stable with large datasets( learning.test [6x5000]), while it performs fast and seamlessly with small dataset from the paper K2_algorithm.pdf (Ruiz)

To be checked that it is the same in datasets of our interest like child() and asia(). If numerically stable we are free to proceed. If not k2helper() need to be modified.
